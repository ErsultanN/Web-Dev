        <h2 id="post1">Kicking Off 2018 with a Bang</h2>
        <h6>Posted on January 1, 2018</h6>
        <p>So, here we go again — another year, another set of wild dreams and questionable resolutions. In this post, I ramble about what I want to accomplish in 2018, why I think this year will be different (spoiler: it probably won’t), and how I plan to make it awesome anyway. Let’s dive in!</p>

        <h2 id="post2">I Accidentally Became a Gardener</h2>
        <h6>Posted on Semtember 26, 2018</h6>
        <p>It all started with a sad, dying basil plant I forgot about on my windowsill. Fast forward a month, and now my room looks like a jungle. In this post, I talk about how I discovered gardening (thanks, TikTok), what I’ve learned so far, and why growing stuff is surprisingly therapeutic.</p>
